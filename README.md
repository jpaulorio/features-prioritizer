Makes feature prioritization easy

Create features and dimensions then prioritize features by assigning them values for each dimension. The higher the dimension the more it weighs when computing the feature priority.

# Dependencies

# Known issues

1. Removing a dimensions causes an error.

# Roadmap

1. Rearrange dimensions by dragging and dropping them.
2. Support dimensions with negative value (more is worse).
3. Make it pretty!
