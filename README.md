# features-prioritizer
Makes feature prioritization easy

Create features and dimensions then prioritize features by assigning them values for each dimension. The higher the dimension the more it weighs when computing the feature priority.

# Dependencies

install npm or yarn

# Run

npm run start

or

yarn start

# How it works

Add/remove dimensions and features then change the value of the dimensions
for each feature by dragging the sliders.

Change the priority of the dimensions by repositioning them via drag'n drop.

# Known issues

1. None that I'm aware of but probably many. :)

# Roadmap

1. Support dimensions with negative value (more is worse).
2. Add custom weights to dimensions.
3. Make it prettier!
