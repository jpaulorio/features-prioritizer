# features-prioritizer
Makes feature prioritization easy

Create features and dimensions then prioritize features by assigning them values for each dimension. The higher the dimension the more it weighs when computing the feature priority.

# Dependencies

install npm or yarn

# Run

npm run start

or

yarn start

# Known issues

1. Drag & drop allows dragging dimension across features. It should only allow drag within a feature.

# Roadmap

1. Support dimensions with negative value (more is worse).
2. Make it pretty!
